## Collaborative Design Hub

### Purpose
The purpose of this project will be creating a web site where users can collaborate together on design or coding projects. A user will have a dashboard where they can start new design project, describe its objectives, and then invite other people to join in the collaboration project. All invited members will be able to post solutions and ideas to the project page.

### Minimum Features

* User authentication and authorization
* A database that stores user accounts, projects (belonging to users), and solutions (belonging to users and projects)
* An intuitive and visually appealing dashboard UI for creating, viewing, and editing projects
* A means for inviting/adding other users to join the project

### Tools & Technologies

* Javascript
* React.js
* Firebase & Firestore
* NoSQL
* Tailwind and/or css

### Stretch Goals Beyond MVP

* A comment/chat system for users to comment on ideas, possibly to edit or at least propose edits
* A voting or ranking system for users to express preference for one solution vs another
* A versioning and conflict resolution system (similar to Github merging and merge conflicts)
* The ability to upload image or other filetypes to the project
* A graphical representation of the project change history, possibly as a node tree
* A pixel editor for drawing diagrams inside of the project

### Additionla Tools & Technologies For Stretch Goals

* The first three stretch goals would not require additional technologies.
* For uploading different filetypes, I would have to research the Firestore documentation to see how file uploading is supported. It is possible that there is a library for doing this. 
* For the graphical representation and the pixel editor (biggest stretch goal), I would look into using three.js, a javascript library for 3D & 2D animations.
